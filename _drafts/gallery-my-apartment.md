title: "Gallery: 私のアパート (my apartment)"
description: "I’ve been waiting for weeks to finally finish furnishing my small
    Japanese apartment, and with (hopefully) last piece of furniture arriving
    this Friday and everything looking exactly as I wish it to look, I can
    finally share the fruits of my labour with you. This is how I live now!"
