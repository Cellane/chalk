  <h1>About me</h1>

  <div class="article-content">
    <p>
      Hi! My name is <strong>Milan Vit</strong> and you have somehow stumbled
      upon my personal web. Not exactly sure how that happened, but welcome
      anyway!
    </p>

    <p>
      Judging from my past experience, I honestly shouldn't promise any articles
      of any kind due to me always losing interest in writing just about few
      weeks into launching a new blog, but if things go differently this time,
      I'd want to share my experience related to programming (mostly iOS related),
      occassionally my random thoughts but perhaps most importantly, experience
      related to Japan, a country that's really dear to my heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      You see, during the entirity of the year 2017, I was attempting to get a
      job in Japan. Luck finally shone upon me in December 2017 and now I'm just
      a few short weeks away from moving to the land of the rising sun, and from
      properly living and working there.
    </p>

    <p>
      And that should hopefully bring a lot of interesting things to write
      about, so look forward to that! Or not, that's actually really up to you.
