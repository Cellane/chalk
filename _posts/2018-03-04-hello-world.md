At any rate, for the past few weeks, I had this annoying feeling at the back of
my head, telling me that I should finally ditch the old and slightly awkward
site I ~~built~~hacked together back in 2014 and follow the trends of the famous
*current year*. Unfortunately, I have never really been a person that quite
follows the current trends, so I picked possibly the most obscure solution for
hosting this website and delivering the content to you.

I may describe it in greater detail in a future article, but just for the
curious types out there, it involves Jekyll, GitHub Pages, Travis CI and has
dependencies written in Python, Ruby and JavaScript. It couldn't turn into more
of a hybrid if I tried, but hey – at least I won't feel the pressure to switch
to this week's most popular JavaScript framework all the time. Oh, and the site
is actually [fully open-source](https://github.com/Cellane/milanvit.net),
because why not.

Anyway, if everything goes well in the few upcoming weeks, I should be steering
my career as an iOS developer in a slightly unconventional direction. I was
recently able to find a job in Tokyo, Japan and am currently in the process of
obtaining work permission and visa. Once that's done, I'll hop on the first
plane going in the general direction of the land of the rising sun and – fingers
crossed, that will be something quite interesting to write about. I really want
to get to know the Japanese work culture (I can already hear the voices saying
"you will regret that wish!") and over time, integrate into their society to the
best of my abilities. I'll be sure to include a lot of photos, too!

In fact, the steering might involve more moving over nine thousand kilometers
to the east. This part is not quite confirmed yet but I have received strong
indications that in my next job, I will be required less as a iOS developer and
more as a back-end developer.

Back-end developer, you might ask? So does that mean that I'll be working in
Python :tired_face:, JavaScript :angry:, or even PHP :rage:? Neither, actually.
Recently, a much better (for me at least) option appeared on the horizon, and
that is server-side Swift, using the brilliant
[Vapor framework](https://vapor.codes). I definitely want to write a tutorial
or two about Vapor and share my experience with it, it's such an amazing
little technology, with truly astonishing community.

Oh, and if for some reason you missed something from the old site (really?
:flushed:), you can still access it [here](https://old.milanvit.net).
